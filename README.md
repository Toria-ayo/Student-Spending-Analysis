## Spendings vs Earnings Analysis

### Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between students’ earnings and spending habits to uncover trends, measure financial imbalance, and generate actionable insights for improving student financial planning.

---

## Key Questions & Methodology

### Do students spend more than they earn on average?

* Monthly income and spending were organized and averaged.
* Pivot tables were used to compare average income and spending.
* Percentage differences were calculated to quantify overspending.
* Helper columns classified students as **overspenders** or **within budget**.

**Finding:**
On average, students spend **176% more than they earn**, indicating a significant financial imbalance.

---

### What are the top spending categories?

* Spending categories were aggregated and visualized using charts.

**Finding:**
**Housing, Food, and Technology** are the top spending categories, accounting for approximately **63% of total student spending**.

---

### Is there a relationship between income and spending?

* A scatter plot was created with income on the x-axis and spending on the y-axis.
* Correlation patterns were examined.

**Finding:**
There is **little to no correlation** between income and spending, suggesting that spending behavior is not income-driven.

---

### Do spending patterns vary by student characteristics?

Spending behavior was further explored across:

* Year of study
* Major
* Age
* Gender
* Financial aid status

This segmentation helps identify groups most vulnerable to overspending.

## Prescriptive Insights & Recommendations

### Closing the Income–Spending Gap

* The average income–spending gap is **176%**.
* To break even, students would need to reduce spending by approximately **$774.43** (a **76% reduction**).
* With an average income of **$1,020.65**, a safer spending target is **$918.59** (≈ **90% of income**).

---

### Category-Level Optimization

* A **20% reduction** in Housing, Food, and Technology alone could save approximately **₦12,800 monthly**.

**Housing Insight:**

* Budget-compliant students spend an average of **$626.64** on housing.
* Overspending students spend **$696.98**.
* Aligning housing costs closer to **$620** mirrors proven low-spend behavior.

---

### Spending by Year of Study

* **Freshman income:** $1,561.41
* **Senior income:** $1,526.95 (↓ $34.46)
* **Freshman spending:** $1,812.95
* **Senior spending:** $1,816.16 (↑ $3.21)

**Insight:**
Senior students earn less but spend slightly more. Matching freshman spending levels would save seniors **$3.21 monthly**, highlighting weak spending adjustment as income declines.

---

### Benchmarking Against Low Spenders

* **25% of students** successfully maintain spending at or below **$1,622**.
* Average students spend nearly **$190 above** this benchmark.

**Insight:**
Living within **$1,622 monthly is achievable**, not theoretical. Aligning average spending to this benchmark could significantly reduce expenses without income growth.

---

### Key Takeaway

* Only **1.4% of students** maintain balanced budgets.
* Overspending is **behavioral rather than income-driven**, with the largest savings opportunities in **housing and technology**, not entertainment.
